You can use the weather variable to create commands that display weather information for a specific location.

Nighbot docs:

This tutorial is to make a ninghbot command for weather report in a language other than English, whose default output is in English.

I'll make an example in Spanish for a command on Twitch, but you can do it in any language and on any platform that accepts Nightbot.

<b>Follow these next steps below:</b>

1. First we need to create a json URL to replace the english words to another, since the twitch chat is limited to 255 characters, and to do the translation we need more space.There's a web page, in which we can place the code to be able to make the translation, and make a request to obtain it.
